# Project 5: Web Directory Bruteforce

## 1. Introduction
The goal of this project is to simulate a penetration testing scenario where hidden directories and endpoints on a test website are discovered using brute force enumeration techniques. This is conducted in a controlled, ethical environment, such as a local setup or a platform like TryHackMe, to avoid any unauthorized access. The focus is on identifying potential hidden paths that could expose sensitive information if not properly secured.

## 2. Abstract
This project demonstrates web directory brute forcing, a common reconnaissance technique in ethical hacking. It involves systematically guessing directory names and file paths using automated tools and wordlists to uncover non-public resources on a web server. This matters because hidden directories can lead to vulnerabilities like information disclosure, unauthorized access, or further exploitation in real-world scenarios. By performing this on a test domain, we learn how attackers might enumerate web applications and how defenders can mitigate such risks through proper configuration.

## 3. Tools Used
- **Dirb**: A web content scanner for brute forcing directories and files.
- **Gobuster**: A faster alternative to Dirb, written in Go, for directory and DNS enumeration.
- **Wordlists**: SecLists (common directories wordlist, e.g., directory-list-2.3-medium.txt) for providing potential path guesses.
- **Operating System**: Kali Linux (version 2025.3, as it's pre-installed with many security tools).
- **Packages/Libraries**: No additional libraries needed beyond what's included in Kali; wordlists downloaded from GitHub repositories like danielmiessler/SecLists.

## 4. Steps Involved in Building the Project
1. **Set Up the Test Environment**: Use a platform like TryHackMe for a safe, legal target. For this project, I spun up the "Web Scanning" room on TryHackMe, which provides a vulnerable web server at a given IP (e.g., http://10.10.10.09). Alternatively, set up a local vulnerable web app like DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) on a VM.

2. **Install or Verify Tools**: On Kali Linux, Dirb and Gobuster are often pre-installed. If not, install Gobuster via `sudo apt update && sudo apt install gobuster`. Download a wordlist: `git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git` and navigate to `/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/`.

3. **Select and Run the Tool**: Choose Gobuster for its speed. Run the command: `gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.09/ -w /path/to/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50` (where `-u` is the URL, `-w` is the wordlist, `-t 50` sets 50 threads for faster scanning). For Dirb: `dirb http://<target-ip>/ /path/to/wordlist.txt`.

4. **Analyze Response Codes**: Monitor output for HTTP status codes:
   - 200: Successful (page exists).
   - 301/302: Redirect (possible hidden area).
   - 403: Forbidden (exists but access denied—worth noting).
   - 404: Not found (ignore).

5. **Document Hidden Paths**: Log discovered paths like /admin, /backup, or /config. Test them manually in a browser to confirm.

6. **Suggest Access Restrictions**: 
   - Add rules to `.htaccess` (for Apache): `Deny from all` for sensitive directories.
   - Use `robots.txt` to disallow crawling: `User-agent: * Disallow: /admin/`.
   - Implement authentication or IP whitelisting.
   - Regularly audit and remove unnecessary directories.

## 5. Screenshots/Outputs
Since this is a text-based report, I'll provide sample command outputs instead of actual screenshots. In a real setup, you'd capture terminal screens or browser views.

- **Sample Gobuster Command and Output**:
  ```
  gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.09/ -w /SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50

  ```
  This output shows discovered paths like /admin (forbidden, potential risk) and /backup (accessible, could contain sensitive files).

- **Manual Verification**: Browsing to http://10.10.10.09/backup might reveal a login page or files—document any findings, e.g., "Exposed backup directory containing database dumps."

## 6. Conclusion
This project successfully enumerated hidden directories on a test web server, revealing paths like /admin and /backup that could pose security risks if left unprotected. I learned the importance of web reconnaissance in penetration testing, how tools like Gobuster efficiently scan for vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies such as using .htaccess or robots.txt to restrict access. Overall, it highlights why web developers should minimize exposed endpoints and conduct regular security audits.

## 7. Challenges Faced (Optional)
One challenge was selecting an effective wordlist—smaller lists missed paths, while larger ones took longer to scan. Tuning threads (-t) in Gobuster helped balance speed and thoroughness. Also, false positives from 403 codes required manual verification to confirm actual risks.
